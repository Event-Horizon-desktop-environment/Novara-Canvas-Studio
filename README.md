# Novara Canvas Studio

A Linux-only, and will stay linux only! Windows has too many windows and it's time for linux to have it's own software
source-built **nonlinear video editor** with a dark, tool-grade
flavor: a proper timeline with a pinned ruler/minimap/timecode strip,
linked A/V editing, hardware-accelerated decode and encode, and a headless
engine tested separately from the GUI. LTS distro's will not support this video editor unless it's modern. 


C++20, Qt 6, FFmpeg. It builds from your system packages; the only fetched
dependency is whisper.cpp via CMake `FetchContent` (network needed on the first
configure), plus an in-tree copy of rnnoise for voice isolation.

## Status

Alpha, very much in motion. As of 2026-09-17 the app builds warning-free
(Debug + Release), the 77-test suite passes except for two Vulkan
render-kernel SKIP-as-fail WIP stubs (75/77), and the current feature
surface is catalogued in
[docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md). The project was renamed (from Event
Horizon Studio, via Nova Canvas Studio) to **Novara Canvas Studio** — binary
`canvas`, project files still read the legacy format. Details, honesty
included, live in
[Current State](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md).

## Quick start

```sh
./build.sh                 # build → ./build/gui/canvas
./build/gui/canvas         # run
ctest --test-dir build     # tests
```

`./build.sh -d` installs dependencies through your package manager
(Fedora/Arch/Debian/Ubuntu/PikaOS) after confirming. More in
[Building](docs/BUILDING.md).

## What you get

The full feature list is in [docs/FEATURES.md](docs/FEATURES.md); in brief:

- Undoable editing with linked A/V pairs, transitions, snapping, ripple
  delete, blade, and a snapshot-based command stack
- A timeline that feels like the tools you already know: pinned ruler +
  minimap + live timecode bar, playhead over the grid, scrub by clicking the
  ruler or dragging the playhead, and a divider band that pans the channels
  (pull up = hit the limit, pull down = slide into the void)
- FFmpeg decode/encode with hardware paths when available (NVENC/VAAPI/QSV,
  plus a CUDA fast path if you have a toolkit), ALSA/PipeWire audio,
  background export with a Deliver-style settings page
- A clean core/GUI split with tests that run headlessly and don't need a
  display

## Reading the source

- [Features](docs/FEATURES.md) — what works, with status markers
- [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — how `core/` and `gui/` fit
  together, the timeline model, the playback and export pipelines
- [Dependencies](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md) — exactly what we link and why,
  with per-distro package lists
- [Building & Testing](docs/BUILDING.md) — build script, install/uninstall,
  the test suite
- [Current State](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md) — what works, known issues, recent
  changes
- [Keyboard Shortcuts](docs/KEYBINDS.md) — every keybind bound so far, by area

## Quick notes

- **Engine is Qt-free on purpose.** `core/` never includes Qt; a build-time
  guard (`scripts/check_qtdep.sh`) enforces it.
- **Zero-warning rule** — every build and test target must compile clean; a
  warning is treated as a defect.
